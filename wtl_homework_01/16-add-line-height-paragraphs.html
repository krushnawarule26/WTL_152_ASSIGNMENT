    <h1>Line Height Example</h1>
    <p>This paragraph has increased line height. Notice how there's more space between each line of text. This makes the text easier to read and gives it a more spacious appearance.</p>
    <p>Here's another paragraph with the same line height. The line-height property controls the vertical space between lines of text. A value of 2 means the line height is twice the font size.</p>
    <p>This third paragraph also demonstrates the increased line spacing. It's especially useful for longer paragraphs where readability is important.</p>
    <div>This div element doesn't have the line-height property, so it keeps normal spacing.</div>
