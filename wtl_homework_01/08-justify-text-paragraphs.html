    <h1>Justified Text Example</h1>
    <p>This paragraph has justified text. Notice how the text spreads out to fill the entire width of the container, creating straight edges on both the left and right sides. This makes the text look more formal and organized.</p>
    <p>Here's another paragraph with justified text. The words are spaced out evenly across the line, making both the left and right margins align perfectly. This is commonly used in newspapers and formal documents.</p>
    <p>Justified text creates a clean, professional appearance by ensuring that all lines of text (except the last line of each paragraph) extend to both the left and right margins.</p>
